    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This pasta sauce is excellent in lasagna or as a meat sauce. I use it in my popular lasagna recipe, so I thought I'd share it on its own.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage, sliced </li>

        <li> ¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
            
        <li> ½ cup minced onion </li>
            
        <li> 2 cloves garlic, crushed </li>
            
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, beef, onion, and garlic in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until browned; drain fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Mix in sugar, basil, Italian seasoning, fennel seed, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
